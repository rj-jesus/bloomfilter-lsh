SUBJECT: Re: Re: Lenny - GNOME FTP Connect To Server

Not with a different server, but I have tested it with a different
client - command line FTP - , it works in text and binary mode and I can
upload files to the server. I cannot figure why in GUI mode it does not
work while in command line it does.
