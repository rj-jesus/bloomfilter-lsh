SUBJECT: Re: XQuartz 2.5.0_rc2

I too have been having issues with gl stuff (work just added some 3d stuff recently to our software). I just figured it was unsupported. 
I'm running (under VMWare) a Fedora 12 x86_64 VM (no VMWare tools installed)... I use ssh -X from OSX to the VM.. I then tried the line you suggested: 
[john@subvale ~]$ LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 glxgears
X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  147 (GLX)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)
  Serial number of failed request:  22
  Current serial number in output stream:  24
I see a window created then disappear, and that error in my ssh session.
(I run other X stuff through that ssh session just fine.)
