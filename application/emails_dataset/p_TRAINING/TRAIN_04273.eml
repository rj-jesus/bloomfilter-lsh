Hmmm...  I just upgraded from my modified 2.31 to a slightly modified 2.40
(I add a routine to EvalTests) and get:
Sep  2 15:32:24 eclectic spamd[20506]: razor2 check skipped: No such file or directory Can't call method
"log" on unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 211, 
line 22. 
I haven't quite figured out why yet, more to come.
