Ext3 basically syncs to disk every 5 seconds or so.  Ext4 didn't, but it's 
possible that has been / will be put back.  XFS uses longer gaps between disk 
syncs by default, but it is tunable.
You could always use the "sync" file system option to avoid the whole issue.  
If that's no good enough, a simple shell script (while sleep 5; do sync; done) 
running as root (perhaps started from init) will fill basically the same role.
Both XFS and Ext3/4 recover through journal replay, and it is usually enough.  
Rarely, a manual filesystem check will be required, and xfs_check is usually 
much faster than fsck.ext3 or even fsck.ext4.
