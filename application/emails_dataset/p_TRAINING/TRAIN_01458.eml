I too have an  Abit NF7 (tho' not an -S).  The memory was installed by the 
shop where I bought the components of my computer.  (I was intending to build 
it myself and he didn't trust me with the CPU or memory!!)  He told me taht I 
had dual channel memory installed, and would need to replace both 256 Mb 
sticks if I increased the memory capacity.
I have never seen any sign of dual channel operation. (Tho' I didn't know what 
to look for, which hardly helped!)
dmidecode gives:

Would I be correct in taking this to mean  that the memory modules appear to 
be incorrectly installed, and that I could improve my memory performance by 
moving one of the modules that dual channel functions?  And also, if that 
does not give me enough improvement (which it almost certainly won't), I 
could add another module in the third channel, which would not necessarily 
need to be the same size as the other two?
