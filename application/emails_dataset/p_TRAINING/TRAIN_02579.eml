The out-of-process Plugin2 should work fine on 32-bit only Macs.
Switching between the in and out-of-process plugins is a simple matter of adding or removing a symlink to the in-process plugin to /Library/Internet Plug-Ins. You should only see grey radio buttons in Java Preferences if you don't have write permissions in that directory. It's possible that if you have other Java plugins present in your ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder, that could be confusing the logic...maybe.
Can you "ls -al@e /Library/Internet\ Plug-ins" and "ls -al@e ~/Library/Internet\ Plug-ins" to see what plugins are present, and if there are any funny ACLs or extended attributes?
Best of luck,

The reason you don't see this behavior when using the out-of-process plugin is because the applet painting is happening in a seperate process, and the browser is "pulling the pixels" from the Java process when the browser thinks it's a good time to repaint.
