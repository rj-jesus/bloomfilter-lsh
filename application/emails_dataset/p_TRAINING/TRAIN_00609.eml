I digged a bit about how the kerneloops daemon works and I guess it does 
not use e-mail but some kind of mix between dbus system to gather 
information about the crash and then it sends the report to the URL 
defined in "kerneloops.conf" file:
http://submit.kerneloops.org/submitoops.php
If you directly load that page, it says:
***
200 thank you for submitting the kernel oops information RemoteIP: [...]
***
Although nothing was send :-P
