I had just finished giving Ben and his sister a "behind
the scenes" look at our set, when Patrick walked in and poked me
in the left arm repeatedly with his index finger - until I hung up
the phone and gave him my full, undivided attention. "Did you know
that your GnomeTomes are being featured in the 'Barnes & Noble'
eBooks section," he asked. Well, that was news to me. After
flailing over to his workstation and flipping through a few pages,
we ultimately realized that he had discovered the entry on the
main page for Amazon's
eBooks. Cool! "With a name that inspires curiosity and sparks the imagination,
Lockergnome represents one of the latest and most popular
additions to our e-documents catalog. At prices starting under $3,
these eminently useful titles from one of the most fanciful-sounding
publishers we've encountered are hard to resist." Thank
you for helping us along, gang. My ultimate goal is to kick that
Godin guy out of the top ten - if only for a day.

I must now thank both Lockergnomie Dan Reain and Nancy Workman-Luter
(both from Sonic Foundry) for donating a couple more prizes
for this year's Gnomedex
conference. Just by walking through the entrance with your
pass in hand, you'll be automatically entered to win one of the
copies of Sound Forge XP! And this software is no slouch; for home
users and professionals on a Windows OS, it's one of the best
audio editors around. If it can't do something you need to have
done, then I bet it can't be done at all. Expect a full
Lockergnome review from our Digital Media editor (Jake) at some
point in the future. Until then, feel free to
download
the demo. If I can ever decide on a digital video camera,
perhaps their Vegas Video will sit on my system, too. Melanie and
I were talking about hardware options the other day. She's leaning
towards a Canon, too. Unless I hear or see otherwise, the ZR45MC
is at the top of my list. Still and low-light images aren't the
best, but I'm not really up for spending much more than $1000.
Neither is Gretchen, oddly enough.
As much as I dislike the AOL client user interface, I gotta admit:
it's pretty darn powerful underneath. For instance, you can
"unsend" an e-mail message (but only if it was sent to another
America Online member and s/he hasn't read it yet). If you travel
often, the service is a bargain. If you know someone who just
needs the Internet basics, it's perfect. One caveat: the software
puts RealPlayer on your system without asking you first. I was a
little upset when I discovered its icon sitting in my Start Menu.
Nowhere during the installation process did I see a way to opt out
of it. I'm not surprised; there are more advertisements on AOL
than there are from your average "free" Web page host. You may
have asked yourself: "What is Chris doing installing AOL in the
first place?!" I don't blame
you. No, hell did not freeze over. We've been doing tips for
their users on our show lately, and I decided to throw it on my
laptop for testing purposes. Perhaps 8.0 will be better?
See You in August,              Chris Pirillo

SEPopular v1.02 [2.4M] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.monocle-solutions.com/sepopular/sepopular.shtml
{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.
MB-Ruler v0.93 [441k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.markus-bader.de/MB-Ruler/
{Measure distance and angles} I was never very good in geometry... Pythagoras would be disappointed that I can never exactly remember his theorem. (What did a hippopotamus have to do with triangles anyway? That animal seems to be pretty round if you ask me...) Anyway, MB-Ruler is quite a useful little application, especially for anyone who has had to work with banners and graphics for the Web. You can measure angles in radians or degrees, and distances in inches, centimeters, twips, points or pixels. And if those weren't enough options, you can even set your own scale. Everything about MB-Ruler can be customized, including its size and color. Talk about an application that "measures up!"

Your Outlook Express Password Is Not Retained
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q264672
{Fixing password problems} Now where did I put that password? I thought I had Outlook Express keeping track of it for me... If you use Outlook Express (for Windows 2000 or Windows XP) to check your e-mail, then this article is for you. Occasionally your password for Outlook Express is not retained, even though you have checked the "Remember Password" checkbox. To fix this particular issue, you will need Administrator privileges in order to make some modifications to your system's registry. The article contains steps for backing up your registry and, since you can cause a lot of accidental damage while tweaking the registry... I would recommend that you follow them.

Re-route E-mail Forwarding Service
http://www.re-route.com/
Soon, it will be time for us to fill out the change of address cards as we relocate to a different area of the city. You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!
s? Sounds like money well spent!

 GnomeTIP
Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.
