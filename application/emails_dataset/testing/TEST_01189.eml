Last week, Axialis Software
released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon
editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I
asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one.
Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a
nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on
the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons
between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE]
DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon Contest), and
one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from DeviantArt,
KarmaGirl from WinCustomize, Voodoo from
Neowin, and Marc from
Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not
only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some
of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the
software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't
hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least
fame and free software.
Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new
(unofficial) Google SearchTool
today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry,
I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave
Cacheman
another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a
great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good.
The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow,
my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is
Repligator 9.0. It gives
me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital
photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest
Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine,
which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just
wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and "12 Mistakes
Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy" is available for FREE
with the purchase of ANY GnomeTome (including our 50
freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know
as much as s/he should.
There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on Emusic now. They inked a
deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any
more to get access to even more MP3s. This is the ONLY
way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will
eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a
place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters
knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has
encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is
NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains
flexible and not controlled by any one company. This
Palladium
thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the
service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives
people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate
to admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM.
I best not find out that you're part of the problem.
See You in August,              Chris Pirillo

Groone's Recipe Holder v1.1.0 [8.2M] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.groonesworld.com/rholder.htm
{Recipe lister} The best thing about this recipe holder? The
conversion calculator. I've always wondered how many teaspoons
were in a gallon. There are a few delicious recipes already
included, to help you start your collection of favorites.
Everything is nicely divided into categories, too. Need a salad?
Then click "Soups & Salads." (Easy!) You can also make shopping
lists. The printing capability is nice too, since I'm assuming
most of you don't keep your computer next to the stove. "If you
have an up-to-date computer with Win2000, XP, or 98SE with the
latest version of IE, then you can download the version with no
runtime support since your computer has all the necessary files."
SolarInfo v1.0 [1.1M] FREE
http://www.sulaco.co.za/downloads.htm
{Sun, moon, and planets} Why is it all the other planets have
really cool names for their respective moon(s), but Earth's is
simply referred to as "moon?" We should change it to something
catchier, like "Joey Joe-Joe Junior Shabbadu." Don't mind me, I
was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single "day" lasts on different
planets. Did you know one day on Pluto is equal to six days on
Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree
for longer than we thought.

TightVNC v1.2.4 [660k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.tightvnc.com/
"VNC (an abbreviation for Virtual Network Computing) is a great
client / server software package allowing remote network access to
graphical desktops. With VNC, you may allow yourself to access
your machine from everywhere provided that your machine is
connected to the Internet. VNC is free (released under the GNU
General Public License) and it's available on most platforms. The
original VNC distribution can be obtained at the AT&T research
labs site. Here you can find enhanced version of VNC, called
TightVNC (grown from the VNC Tight Encoder project), which is
optimized to work over slow network connections such as low-speed
modem links. While original VNC may be very slow when your
connection is not fast enough, with TightVNC you can work remotely
almost in real time in most environments. Besides bandwidth
optimizations, TightVNC also includes many other improvements,
optimizations and bug fixes over VNC."

Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software
Scribbled by Pat Wong
http://popup.jscentral.com/
I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation
menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use.
Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

Calculator
Unearthed by a Gnomie
http://www.calculator.com/
{Calculate it} Calculators aren't just for adding and subtracting
numbers or spelling silly phrases by turning the calculator upside
down. How about figuring out the financing on your new car? What
about the seeding rates for your wheat farm? Perhaps you
programmers out there need a nice HEX calculator. And, of course,
what football fan wouldn't like to calculate the passing rates for
his or her favorite quarterback? If it seems like I'm all over the
map here, it's because this site provides links to all kinds of
calculator sites for all kinds of people. Trust me: it all adds up
to a unique and useful site.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: "In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50.  However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges." For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found
IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

And now, we see the story of the ugly shoe unfold before our very eyes. This footwear was outcast from the group weeks ago, and has been very depressed ever since. Pity my shoe.
