Greetings!
If you're thinking about a new job, now's the time to
aggressively pick up your search. Many people slow
their job search donw in summer months when in fact
it's the best time to look!
Here's why.  Many companies implement a new direction
or strategy at the first of the year, resulting in a
first of the year hiring surge. By mid year, with
results in hand, companies start hiring again to
expand on or adjust for the results of their first of
the year plans.
While employers start hiring, job seekers start
slowing their search efforts down. This creates an
optimal job seeking environment of more jobs and less
competition!
To best take advantage of this situation you should give
yourself massive exposure by signing up to all the top
career sites as soon as possible. Of course it will take
a little time, but it's well worth it. The top career
sites are visited by 1.5 million employers and recruiters
daily - And collectively list millions of jobs.
If you want to save 60 hours of research and data entry,
try a service called ResumeRabbit.com.  They instantly
post your resume to 75 the top career sites at once.

When searching for a new job, it's important to work
smart and cover a lot of ground. Today's serious job
seeker must take a multi-pronged approach to succeed.
This should include networking, reading all the
classifieds, posting your resume on all the top career
sites and searching job listings on these sites daily.
We recommend you try http://start.resumerabbit.com
It's a quality service that delivers what it promises.
>>From mid November to mid January, the holidays have
a "slowing down" effect on hiring. Since the job search
process can often be several months, waiting until the
end of summer to get started may push your new job off
well after the new year.  Now's the optimum time to
aggressively mount your search!
Sincerely,
Steve Adler
