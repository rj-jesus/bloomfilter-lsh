You're a good bunch, you Penguins.
Today's GnomeVOICE really tells the story better than I can, but I'll give you a 
quick summary. Through your efforts and compassion, reader Karl Steenblik has 
found a new electronic home for the Foundation for Children and Youth With 
Diabetes. I'll let Karl tell you which offered solution suited his needs. But, 
with the volume of responses his request for help generated, it's almost 
irrelevant. As I expected, we came together as a community and collectively 
offered him many viable choices from which to pick a solution that would work 
for the kids. The global scope of your concern and our collective ability to 
effect a change has humbled me once again. Just when you start to get a little 
callous about the 'Net ...
Accordingly, I'd like to sketch out an idea with you that can be an ongoing part 
of Penguin Shell. It's an open discussion, really, about how we can further put 
our technical skills (be they Linux or Windows skills) to work for a good 
cause. I'm proposing that we start an organized volunteer effort, based in the 
Penguin Shell readership, to provide volunteer technical services to worthwhile 
charitable organizations. First, we need a name that clearly describes our purpose. Next, we need 
volunteers with the time and ability to lend those skills to a good cause. Finally, we'll need some suggestions as to 
the charitable organizations that are near and dear to your heart. Or, 
maybe the organization is one you're already working with - one you're certain 
can use some hands-on or remote volunteer help.
I'll start that ball rolling with a personal organizational suggestions - the Aicardi Syndrome Foundation. 
Though I don't currently know their technical needs, I do know that the syndrome 
is very rare - read "research and technical dollars are minimal." I'm sure we 
can, as a group, provide them a way to fill existing technical holes.
That's just a suggestion. Feel free to use the mailto links above to make 
others.
Over the next few weeks, I plan on modifying my current favorite blogging 
program, GeekLog 
to pull together a community project area where interested parties can gather, 
coordinate and discuss whatever this project might become. I'll keep you posted 
on the details.
In one of the earliest issues of Penguin Shell, I told a story about Emperor 
Penguins - how they huddle together on the shore, knowing that their protection 
from predators lies in sheer numbers. When one takes the leap into the water, 
all the others follow; individual involvement for the good of the community.
Where could the analogy possibly be more fitting?

Quick Shortcuts
Linux is chock full of keyboard shortcuts that, when used, streamline the way 
you use your system. Today's Tweaks are really user tweaks - built in shortcuts 
you can use to maximize your Linux efficiency. You don't have to change your 
system, just how you use what's already there. They're two tips that are quick 
and very easy to learn and remember.
Got a cluttered console screen? Use [ctrl]+l to clear it. This does the 
same thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes.
Do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? Use the [ctrl+d key 
combination. This will log out the current user. If you're using bash and the 
current user is not root, the [ctrl]+d combination will close the terminal 
window, as well.
To me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. Better yet, if I can 
avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then 
I've really saved some time. Though it's tough to quantify the time savings 
using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively I can tell you it's 
substantial.
Maximum efficiency. That's what Tweaks are all about.

Kernel Configuration - Part XI
We've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration 
series. Today's topic requires a bit of review. We'll discuss configuring block 
devices in your kernel.
We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell 
issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and 
character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data. 
Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of 
data "blocks." Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data 
to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data 
intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power 
dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up 
to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.
Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in "streams," one character 
at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle 
data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then 
committing the data.
The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why 
they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or 
retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc 
surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where 
there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under 
the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data 
together.
Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget 
about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. 
The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The 
storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical 
storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account 
for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal 
back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that 
character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.
So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the 
system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined 
level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the 
hard drive disc surface. Even though that's the highest level view of the 
process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really 
is.
In the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. 
When configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing 
hardware as possible. What type (brand) of hard drives are you using? What's the 
interface to the machine - IDE, parallel, etc? Where is the drive located - on 
the local machine or on a network-connected box? Because the variables are so 
broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will 
work for your personal machine every time. I can tell you this - you will have 
block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as 
many of the above questions as you can. Find out as much about these physical 
devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively 
painless.
A warning - you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues 
to progress. I'll certainly make hands-on configuration recommendations where 
possible. There are quite a few areas where I can make such recommendations. 
However, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the 
legwork will be up to you.
Tomorrow, we'll talk about RAID and multi-device support in Linux.

rxLinux
http://www.fusionw3.com/rxlinux/ 
"The concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of 
multiple Linux servers. New servers can be deployed in minutes. A Web interface 
is used to build custom ISO CD-ROMs dedicated for specific servers. Servers, 
also called rxnodes, boot up from that CD-ROM and get the rest of the 
configuration and software from a master server. No administration is done 
directly on the nodes; everything is controlled from the master servers. When 
the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is completely 
independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot."

generated.  I have had over 20 offers for help.  Some of the offers would
not fit our space needs but that number of responses shows that Linux
people care.
"I am overwhelmed with gratitude with Lockergnome and

"Bill at Digitaldaze has sent us a large gift of 100 MB of space.  More
that I think we will ever use.
"I thank all of the people who offered help.  There are more generous
people than I can type to individually.  Our camp will hold Linux people
in the highest esteem and I will make sure Linux, Lockergnome, and
Digitaldaze have a prominent places on our site in the future.

Software.Linux.Com is the revitalized version of Linux.DaveCentral. True to its 
roots, the site is a great starting point for Linux software and information. 
Software is categorized under such headings as Audio, File Utilities, Office 
Applications, and System Utilities. The site also features up-to-date listings 
of the most recent and most popular Linux software, as well as a program of the 
day. This site will definitely get bigger, but even for now, it's got nearly any 
Linux app you're looking for.
