Hi 
                  Jm, 
Thanks 
                    for visiting http://www.seekercenter.net. 
                    
Over 
                    90% web surfers use search engines to locate their needed 
                    info nowadays, so your web site is only effective when people 
                    can find it. If you are not listed on search engines - you 
                    lose. Nobody shows up no matter how attractive you made your 
                    site. As well, the investment you made in building it will 
                    not yield any dividends at all!
As 
                    a popular site promotion tool, SeekerCenter uniquely submits 
                    your website to 500,000+ search engines and directories worldwide, 
                    attracting great traffic to your business website.
