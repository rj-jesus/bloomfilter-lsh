SUBJECT: Apt problems

Two issues:
----
Sorry, but the following packages have unmet dependencies:
  openssh: Depends: openssl (= 0.9.5a) but 0.9.6b-8 is installed
  php-pgsql: Depends: postgresql but it is not installed
             Depends: libpq.so.2
E: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.
----
1. I have the following openssl packages installed:
----
openssl-perl-0.9.6b-8
openssl-0.9.6b-8
openssl095a-0.9.5a-11
openssl-devel-0.9.6b-8
----
The openssl095a package should provide the openssl-0.9.5a compatibility 
but apt doesn't think so? 
2. I have postgresql installed from the source. So that's why I need 
php-pgsql. Is there a way to tell apt about packages I don't want it to 
complain about?
