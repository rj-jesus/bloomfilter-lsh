Greetings from Download.com!
If you're developing Windows applications in an
ActiveX-compatible environment (which includes most major ones
such as Visual Basic and C++), it's time you started taking
advantage of prefab programming components. An amazing array of
controls are out there, with more arriving at Download.com
every day. This week, we've collected the top programs that
handle transparent GIF files, offer prebuilt ActiveX controls,
and edit hex code to get you up and running.
Also this week, we've got two really useful ActiveX entries:
FileSystem 1.2 and AppSecureX 2.9. FileSystem gives you access
to drives, folders, and I/O operations; and AppSecureX adds
serial number and shareware-type functionality to your
applications.

Six
MySQL/PHP functions to streamline development
Code reuse is one of the keys to increasing developer
     productivity. This article looks at several handy functions
     you can use to save time when building applications using
     PHP and MySQL.
Faking
SOAP principles with familiar techniques
SOAP is everywhere you turn. But what exactly is it? Take
     this guided tour to gain working knowledge of this emerging
     standard.
in ActiveX
FileSystem 1.2
Having problems wrangling the Windows File System? The
   FileSystem ActiveX control offers complete access to common
   file information under Windows through three independent
   interfaces. Everything from drive and folder access to file
   I/O operations is available with only a few lines of code.
   Use this control's interfaces to detect media types and
   media insertion, get complete lists of folders and files at
   unlimited folder depth, find out what attributes are set on
   files, and even load logbook files into collections
   automatically. Rope in your files.
ApSecureX 2.9
Prevent pirates from copying your software with AppSecureX.
   This control provides a registration system that produces a
   valid serial number customized to the user's machine. When
   the user installs your software, a unique ID number is
   generated for that system. To get the serial number, the
   user must provide you with his installation number. The
   data file created by the application is encrypted
   differently for each system, so even if someone were to
   crack the file, they couldn't use the information on
   another machine. AppSecure can also give your software
   shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking
   to see if the system clock is set back, and so on. AppSecureX
   works with any ActiveX-enabled programming language such as
   Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++. A demo
   application is included. Lock up your software.
in Java
AppletFile 2.5
AppletFile is a set of Java applets that will enhance your
   Web site's file upload and download capabilities. In
   addition to support for SSL, proxy, and authenticated
   uploading, users can upload and download multiple files
   using predefined paths to automate the process as much as
   possible. A scripting language provides for sophisticated
   customization, and the user interface includes support for
   12 different languages. Transfers are faster because the
   applet uses its own compression (AutoZIP). The AutoSYNC
   feature downloads only updated files, and verification of
   file transfer integrity is made possible with built-in
   support for MD5 message digests. AppletFile is based on
   HTTP protocols and is firewall-friendly. This update adds
   Sun's Java Plug-in support for Netscape 6+ browsers and
   shows removable media drives in the browse dialog. Beam up
   your files.
in Tools & Editors
PHP Master Editor 2.0
Write, edit, and debug PHP scripts and HTML pages with this
   tool. PHP Master Editor includes an internal browser for
   viewing, as well as a debugger for local testing. Basic FTP
   capability is also included. Specifically designed for PHP
   programmers, the program recognizes and formats functions,
   variables, and classes within the code, and features
   customizable code templates. Get code-happy.
