Thanks Anand,
In single user mode, I can login on the first virtual console but every 
other ctrl+alt+Fn I hit only gives me a black screen with a prompt 
flashing in the upper left corner ...
Launching a graphic session with startx instead of gdm/kdm doesn't 
change anything except that I don't even have any flashing prompt on my 
black screen anymore.
Any help would be appreciated.
