Microsoft unbundles directory technology
Microsoft will begin selling its directory technology as a standalone product separate from the Windows operating system.
Microsoft will continue to build in its "Active Directory" as part of Windows, but will give its customers the new option of buying the technology as a separate product next year, Microsoft executives said this week. The directory technology essentially provides a network manager with a central database to store and manage information about users, computer systems and networking devices. Microsoft competes against Novell and Sun Microsystems in the directory-server software market.

Pittman set to leave AOL Time Warner
AOL Time Warner is expected to announce after the stock markets close Thursday that embattled chief operating officer Robert Pittman will relinquish his role as the media behemoth's No. 2 executive, according to a source close to the company.
Pittman, who also serves as the interim chief exective of the company's America Online unit, could remain at the online division until a permanent CEO is found. But the timetable for Pittman's departure will be based on his own decision, the source added. AOL Time Warner last week confirmed that it hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart to head AOL's CEO search.
