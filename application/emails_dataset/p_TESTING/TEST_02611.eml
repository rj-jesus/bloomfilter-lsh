The online content business.
Dear Friends,
The online content business is doing fantastic.
Sound crazy? Perhaps.  With 
advertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin
for the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying
off staff and pulling back on their offerings.
However,  this horrible environment
has resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging
people to pay for content.  Finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real
world,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.
 U.S.  consumers spent $675 millionÂ on paidÂ online content last
year,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to Online
Publishers Association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially
this year.  Look at these success stories:
New York Times Digital has 
been steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and 
registered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.
TheStreet.com brought over 
$3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent 
over the year-ago quarter.
ConsumerReports.com will 
reach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.
RealNetworks' consumer multi-media 
subscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8 
million in the last quarter.
The Wall Street Journal Online
added over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber
base to 646,000.
FT.com has signed up 17,000 
subscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May.
In recognition of this trend we're hosting 
the third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, 
2002.  The event charts the changes in the content industry from free 
to paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.
Our previous Content Management 
Summit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City 
and January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.
The Content Management Summit 
III,  taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10, 
2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and 
distribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical 
solutions.
The event will feature presentations 
from software and services companies providing services
and solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.
We're thrilled that 
Microsoft,  TeleKnowledge,  eMeta,  and Liquify will all be demonstrating 
their latest products and services.
The event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.
 These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges
facing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since
the dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  The panels will
feature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive
question and answer session with the audience.
Among the round table topics will be:
Weblogs:  how they are affecting big media 
companies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.
Financial news and information 
companies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, 
and how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.
Business information services 
such as Hoovers,  Lexis-Nexis and others:  best practices in the industry, 
 niche product launches and revenue streams.
Daily news/newspaper companies 
publishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards
paid content and its implications,  among other issues.
Consumer and entertainment 
publishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, 
 the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.
Join us on October 10th 
for this very important event.  If you are directly responsible 
for content management at a major content site you may qualify for 
a VIP ticket.  Please e-mail your request with your name,  title and bio to
invite@cmsummit.com.  If you are
with a software or services provider,  or anyone not directly responsible 
for the purchase of content management software or solutions,  you can purchase 
a ticket to this event for $1,200 at invite@cmsummit.com.
