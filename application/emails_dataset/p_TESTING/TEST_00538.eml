SUBJECT: Debian in Debian via Virtual box

Hi,
How have people managed to get debian in virtual box to display with a
resolution higher than 800x600. I've tried reinstalling with a higher video
memory setting  and installing the guest additions. Was finding it difficult
to find out if the additions actually installed correctly, so if anyone can
help me with that I'd be grateful.
Best regards
Jim
