A UPS probably won't last that long (the battery isn't designed for that 
AFAIK).  However it is something that isn't replaced often, since power has 
been fairly standard (V / Hz / Plug shape and polarity) for a while.
For those reasons and more, a working UPS is rather hard to find when 
dumpster-diving.
Also, clean power should make your existing hardware last longer.  That might 
be a big plus since you may be the type that never disposes of working 
hardware.
