The Lenny kernel is configured with POSIX ACL support for ext2/3/4dev and 
generic ACL support.  I don't think you'll need to patch the kernel, but I 
could be wrong.

XFS is mature, fast, and well-supported by the kernel team.  If your system is 
subject to unclean shutdowns (e.g. power failure w/o a UPS), you might want to 
tune your system to flush the XFS cache to disk a bit more often than the 
defaults.
