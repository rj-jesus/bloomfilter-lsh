Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Every day of the week, I get questions from people all  
 over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 wanting to know some of the most valuable "secrets" 
 to my on-going internet success.
 
Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 *true* "secrets" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 become successful in the online world is not a "secret", 
 in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 Net or off.
 
But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 consultation, or simply asking, "What's your secret?", 
 I have to blush & say ...
 
Persistence and personality.
 
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 It's not years of digging to find the "secrets" to internet riches.
 
One thing that "gets to me" so often in my work as an 
 Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that "success" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 
Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
the Bank. Get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . 
 But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 "self marketing" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only "real" place it ever was anyhow!
 
Yes, "persistence and personality" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 
That may be the most incredible "secret" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
Talk about SIMPLE!!

Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!
 Jeff and Rebecca Marks http://www.grand-champion.com
-------------------------------------------------
Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.
