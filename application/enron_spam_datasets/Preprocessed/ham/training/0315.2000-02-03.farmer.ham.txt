jackie i talked with daren and we would like to wait for now , it is a little
early in the month and the well may be just getting revved up . wells tend to
move around a bit through the month and usually even out at the end but
thank you for bringing it to my attention and please feel free to inform me
of any others that you might see . the more eyes the better . thanks jackie .
