SUBJECT: GRUB2 resolution

I have looked around on google and found some documentation to set the
resolution within grub2 but some of the explanations are a bit vague.  Can
someone post a clear and concise way of doing this?  When I tried the ones I
found on google, I managed to make the box not boot anymore.
