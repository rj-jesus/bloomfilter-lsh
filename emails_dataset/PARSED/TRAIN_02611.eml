liberalism
propagandized as meddling
in truth, the middle

"American liberalism believes that in this respect it has made a major
contribution to the grand strategy of freedom. Where both capitalists and
socialists in the 1930's were trying to narrow the choice to either/or --
either laissez-faire capitalism or bureaucratic socialism -- the New Deal
persisted in its vigorous faith that human intelligence and social
experiment could work out a stable foundation for freedom in a context of
security and for security in a context of freedom. That faith remains the
best hope of free society today."
